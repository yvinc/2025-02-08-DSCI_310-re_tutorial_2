## Part 1: Git + GitHub

    - git switch
    - git log --oneline --graph --all

4. add/commit/push your definitions to your github repository

(done)

## Part 2: Branches and Pull Requests (PRs)

1. Create a new branch (does not matter what name you give it)

2. In the new branch define the following terms:

    - **branch**: create a 'copy' of the repo off the main branch. In this separate branch, changes can be made without affecting anything in the main branch. 
    - **pull request**: is a proposal made on Github to merge changes from one branch into another branch (typically into the main branch).
        - (This is an addition line to practice one more pull request b1 --> main)

3. Push your branch up to github and create a pull request

4. Make a comment in your own pull request

5. Merge your pull request into main

6. Update your local main branch

    - git commit: Git commit commits a snap shot of the current changes made in the current working directory. üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

3. Push this branch and create a PR, but DO NOT merge it
